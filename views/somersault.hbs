      IBM released the IBM Swift Sandbox to help devs get
      started quickly with the language. Later, the IBM Swift Package Catalog was
      released to help Swift developers easily find packages compatible with the
      Swift Package Manager. I've been on both as the lead web developer and Scrum
      Master.

      <p>Acting as both roles for both projects
      has taught me not only how to develop entire front-ends and Node servers at
      scale, but also how to plan and lead a development effort with tight schdules
      and deadlines. And let me say, making bleeding-edge products with developers
      as the primary focus is pretty satisfying.</p>
